What can be added/improved in the program?
- UI
- Strict Error handling
- Functions to add Patient's details (such as first name and last name) and save to file
- DBMS


For the UI of the project, and the functionalities, I want it to resemble an actual hospital, and the backend that it entails, and it should, ABSOLUTELY, at all costs, offer a slightly better technical edge, compared to other backend solutions.
Other than that, I need you to DESCRIBE a UI, that incorporates the theme of black, green, and white, and it should be minimalist.
FYI, I am working on the following things, as an addition to the project, now that it needs to be pitched to recruiters, and I need to have a solid addition on my resume.


Everything should rely on the simple motto: Keep things simple.
